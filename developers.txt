This file provides some information for developers who want to extend this plugin.

== Adding Styles ==

You can add your own styles to use on the comics. Simply create your CSS rules for a
new class, and add them to your child theme's style.css file. (If you aren't using a
child theme, see http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).

For example:

.chickcomic-container.my-cool-new-style-class {
	/* Your CSS styles here */
}

Then you can add your new style to the available styles by adding a filter for the
styles in your child theme's functions.php file.

For example:

<?php

/**
 * A new function for my cool styles.
 *
 * It needs to take one parameter; this is the array of styles.
 *
 * @filter chickcomic_styles_filter
 *
 * @param array $styles The array of styles.
 *
 * @return array An array of styles.
 */
function function_for_my_cool_styles( $styles ) {

	/*
	 * Add a new element to the array of styles.
	 * Make sure that the [key] matches the new class you added in the CSS.
	 * The value is the name of your style, and can be whatever you want.
	 */
	$styles['my-cool-new-style-class'] = 'My Cool New Style';

	// If you don't return the $styles array, then no styles will work!
	return $styles;
}
add_filter( 'chickcomic_styles_filter', 'function_for_my_cool_styles' );

// ^^ Tell WordPress to add this function as a filter for the Chick Comic styles.

?>

Now you will be able to use your style in the shortcode, and even set it as the
default on the settings page if you want. You can even preview it along with all the
other styles on the preview page!

== Embeding Comics without shortcode ==

You can embed comics in posts and pages with the shortcode, but what if you want to
do something else, like display a random comic in the footer of your website? You can
do that using the display_chickcomic() function. This is the function that the
shortcode uses to display the comics. The function takes the same three parameters as
the shortcode, the only difference being that they must be in order:

1. The id or title of a comic, or 'latest' or 'random'.
2. What to display if the comic is unavailable: 'none', 'default', or 'random'.
3. What style to give the comic.

As with the shortcode, these are all optional, and if they aren't set the defaults
will be used. So you could call the function like this, with no parameters:

display_chickcomic();

Or will all parameters:

display_chickcomic( '1', 'none', 'inset-box' );

If you want to leave out a parameter, but set a later parameter, then just pass null
in place of that parameter:

display_chickcomic( 'random', null, 'inset-box' );

You can use this function anywhere in your PHP code. The function returns a string,
which you will have to echo() to display the comic.

For example:

echo( display_chickcomic() );
